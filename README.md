# Project-Student-management-data

This is a mini project to create a data management system that enters student data starting from name, class, number, city and gender. 
Not only entering data, this code implementation can also delete certain data and also search for certain data in the data file.
The output display of this management system is only a simple data display implementation that is easy to understand.
